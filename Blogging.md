Sway setup (alpine specific, or perhaps just link the sway setup to alpine linux experience and this article should exclusively be about setting up sway, not installing it e.t.c), this article should not be about my setup (although it should mention that you can copy it) but rather it should be a guide on setting up swaywm including informations about various bars, and which one to choose (not to waste time with swaybar), talks about eww and it's alternative, talk about swayfx, talk about that alternatives page. Talk about how to learn about swayWm configuration
