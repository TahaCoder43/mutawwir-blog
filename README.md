# Background
thinking of making a slick video for backgroud, with black overlay on top, and give heading dark glow

Or perhaps, add multiple diagnol screenshots, or computer displaying some thing

# In-page Navbar
A navbar sticking to the bottom, with glassmorphic style, with links linking to headings of the hero page

# Arc
make an arc section that sticks with an arc facing towards right, with scrolling-fading picture and text (paragraph, heading), inside and outside respectively. it should have lines connecting to topics, with a highlight radient gradient, on the line with current topic

This section should link to blog page at various places, with each place representing the topic on the arc

# Seemless lines
add a seemless section with lines as seperators, each with heading, text and simple illustrative picture to tell what it's about

This section to lead to my neural nexus institute, work, and usage of various linux related info

make an illustration for the seamless section above that represents a laptop with window manager, with island style topbar, and tilling WM look. This should be for linux related info
