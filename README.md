# Introduction
The Mutawwir blog, dedicated to coding, linux, dev tools, CLI tools, TUI, softwares, programming languages, frameworks, build tools, web development, IDEs and much more

# Vision

A blog that goes straight to practical. No here and there perhaps we should name it straight to code or straight way to  code (in arabic ofc) and add it in description

so there would be no introduction, just say what your gonna do in the start of each blog and start doing it

but there would be buttons and markers here and there, which would contain the "here and there" blog information like background (why I got here, why am I doig thi, frustrations of people e.t.cc). Maybe this will keep the SEO good too

This blog should lead to my portfolio, so the about us page, will lead to another website which will be my portfolio

# Today TODO

improve the github area by changing the background, and added 3d looking paths, and a spheres and a cube maybe and more stuff

add gradients on the backk of the background video for cool background gradients

add staggering animation when seamles section becomes visible

Decide the blog names, check your chat with chatgpt for it

Now start writing paragraphs, and improve seo (do keyword research, better alts, better file names, better headings, more data-titles, better article dividers (sections footers e.t.c fix that, and use it properly with good seo))


# TODO
- [x] [Hero background](#Background)
- [] [In-page Navbar](#In-page Navbar)
- [x] [image-text arc](#Arc)
- [] [Seemless seperators section](#Seemless lines) 
- [] showcase section on home page, that shows all my cool projects I have undertaken. Or perhaps this should be in portfolio, or in both

# Background
thinking of making a slick video for backgroud, with black overlay on top, and give heading dark glow

Or perhaps, add multiple diagnol screenshots, or computer displaying some thing

# In-page Navbar
A navbar sticking to the bottom, with glassmorphic style, with links linking to headings of the hero page

# Arc
make an arc section that sticks with an arc facing towards right, with scrolling-fading picture and text (paragraph, heading), inside and outside respectively. it should have lines connecting to topics, with a highlight radient gradient, on the line with current topic

This section should link to blog page at various places, with each place representing the topic on the arc

do good SEO

# Seemless lines
add a seemless section with lines as seperators, each with heading, text and simple illustrative picture to tell what it's about

This section to lead to my freelancing, neural nexus institute , and github

improve the github area by changing the background, and added 3d looking paths, and a spheres
