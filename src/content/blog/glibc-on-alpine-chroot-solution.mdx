reasons: ["I know of one reason, that is to install propietary software that does not have pre-compiled Musl-C version. Aside from that, there isn't any reason to get Glib-C support (except maybe because you are bad at compiling and can't compile). Glib-C support may be complicated, and also heavy on the system a lot of times", "Arch is easy to use compared to Gentoo, and it has a lot of packages compared to Debian. To be honest, Arch chroot was much easier to setup than I expected"]

## Introduction

Have you ever faced this

```console
User@Host:~$ application
Error relocating /usr/bin/application/libfoo.so.1: foosymbol: symbol not found
```

Well that is because applications compiled in Glib-C can't be ran on Musl-C. So what's the solution? Many!

- Recompile the application in Musl-C [(Read this article)](https://example.com)
- Somehow get Glib-C support in Musl-C

In this article we we'll look at Getting Glib-C support. <Reason client:load/> for Glib-C support over Recompiling. First of all you should try this simple solution `sudo apk add gcompat`. This may just solve your problem, if not then there are multiple other ways to run Glib-C application.

- Flatpak (Easiest solution, but not every application is on flathub)
- Docker Container
- GlibMus-HQ
- Nix-pkg (maybe)
- Fake Mounts
- Chroot that has Glib-C

Each of these solutions will eat a few GBs. Yikes! {/* Add which solution is the lightest over here */}. In this article we will look at the last solution

## Glib-C Chroot

Alpine wiki has a [guide on running Glib-C applications](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Running_glibc_programs). Among Gentoo and Debian chroots, it has an [option to use Arch-chroot](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Running_glibc_programs#Arch_Linux), but the guide to it is a little outdated and incomplete, here's the steps. <Reason client:load/> to use Arch over Gentoo and Debian

```bash
sudo apk add arch-install-scripts
mkdir ~/Chroots && cd ~/Chroots # I like to keep my chroots here
# this link was outdated on the wiki
curl -o "https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/archlinux/iso/latest/archlinux-bootstrap-2024.10.01-x86_64.tar.zst"
tar --zstd -xf archlinux-bootstrap-2024.10.01-x86_64.tar.zst
sudo sed -i '/evowise/s/^#//' root.x86_64/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist # Commenting out all mirrors
sudo sed -i '/CheckSpace/s/^/#/' root.x86_64/etc/pacman.conf
sudo arch-chroot root.x86_64
```

then in the chroot Run

```bash
pacman-key --init
pacman-key --populate archlinux
```

Now go inside `root.x86_64/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist` (using `nano`) and uncomment one mirror then run `pacman -Syu` for system update. Now run `pacman -Syu package` to install any package. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is one problem tho, pacman will install from core and extra repos have 265 and ~15000 packages respectively, whereas the AUR (Arch User Repository) has ~94,000 packages! (Source: [Arch Package Search](https://archlinux.org/packages/https://archlinux.org/packages/)) So let's setup the AUR helper

## Setting up AUR (Arch User Repository)

You first need to create a user

```bash
useradd -m user
passwd user
```

Next give the neccesary permissions

1. edit `/etc/sudoers` (using `nano`) and uncomment this line `%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`
2. then run `groupmod -aU user wheel`

Now install yay

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
```

Now you can install a package `yay -S package_name`

> [!CAUTION]
> Any user can upload any package on AUR, theoretically one could upload malware, disguised as a software, see this [forum post](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/how-safe-is-aur-and-pacman-in-general/57259/6) and [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/3yiq4s/is_the_aur_safe_to_use/)
